# rustyrocket

Rusty Rocket is a relatively simple PoC game, very similar in basic mechanics to Flappy Bird but with some extra features. It is not meant to a final polished game, but is used as learning project for me to get familiar with [the Bevy game engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy "Bevy") and many of its features.

The goal of the game is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible.

## Bevy version

`rustyrocket` is currently based on bevy version 0.11.
